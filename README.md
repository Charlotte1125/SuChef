# SuChef
Traditional recipe applications provide us with a variety of options to cook from. These applications help us pin recipes from around the world. Many recipe applications today allow us to clip the recipe from around the web and help us to edit them later.  These applications also help us to organize recipes by providing a “drag and drop” features so that we can store them in folders and notebooks.

Presently, most of the applications available provide a variety of options in terms of intake. To list a few, we have categories such as breakfast, lunch, snacks or dinner. These applications provide us with categories specifically for grill, desert, and barbecue. However, most of the applications fail to provide a category or list of recipes based on the ingredients we have at hand. 

To address this issue, we plan to create a mobile application “SuChef” that can help a customer choose the category that can list a number of recipes that can be found based on the ingredients they have at hand. Additionally, users can also set recipes as their favorite, so that it’ll be easier for them to use it in the future.
